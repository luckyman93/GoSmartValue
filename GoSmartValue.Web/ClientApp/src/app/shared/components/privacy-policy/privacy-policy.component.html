<section>
<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We only collect the information that we actually need. Some of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account,
register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us. We store your name and contact information, but we don't store
credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).</p>

<p>When you visit our website , we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features
and settings you use. We use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.</p>

<p>Sometimes we receive information indirectly. If you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or advertising partners,
or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us.
We'll use that information to complete the request that you made. If you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting,
retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information. We'll still have that information even if
you later remove it from the social media site.</p>

<h2>What we do with your information</h2>
<p>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts. We also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates. We analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>

<p>We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information. In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us. When that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>

<p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly. We completely disable third-party cookies from all our products.</p>

<p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it. If we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.</p>

<p>The  Botswana Data Protection Act , 2018 and European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain). Vantage Properties undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.</p>

<p>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Part II – Information that  GoSmartValue processes on your behalf</h3>
<p>If you handle other people's data, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.</p>

<p>You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.</p>

<p>We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use our Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.</p>

<p>If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data. To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.</p>

<h3>Part III – General</h3>
<p>There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you. We will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety. We do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers; when a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.</p>

<p>Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies. Always check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.</p>

<p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums. You can also check our Security Policy and Privacy Policy</p>

<p>We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed here (collectively, "Zoho", "we", "us" or "our") and is effective as of 25th May 2018. It applies to all our divisions: Zoho, ManageEngine, Site24x7, and WebNMS.</p>

<h3>Zoho’s Privacy Commitment</h3>
<p>Zoho has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position. We ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand. We let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements. But, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue—never have, never will—even from the free editions of our products. This means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>

<p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not. This policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases. We will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Scope of this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Vantage Properties websites that link to it. It also applies to the products and services provided by Vantage Properties through these websites, our mobile applications. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</p>

<h3>Part I – Information Vantage Properties collects and controls</h3>
<p>This part deals with how Vantage Properties collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Vantage Properties products and services, and others who contact Vantage Properties through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.</p>

<h3>Part II – Information that Vantage Properties processes on your behalf</h3>
<p>This part deals with how Vantage Properties handles data that you entrust to Vantage Properties  when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.</p>

<h3>Part III – General</h3>

<p>This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Vantage Properties 's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.</p>


<h3>Part I – Information Vantage Properties  collects and controls</h3>

<h3>What information Vantage Properties  collects</h3>

<p>We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose. Vantage Properties  will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Vantage Properties  has automatically collected the information, or (c) Vantage Properties  has obtained the information from a third party. Below we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.</p>


<h3>Information that you provide us</h3>

<p>i. Account signup : When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for information like your name, contact number, email address, company name and country to complete the account signup process. You'll also be required to choose a unique username and a password for accessing the created account. You may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don’t require that information to sign up for an account. After signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question — if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.</p>

<p>ii. Event registrations and other form submissions: We record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event, including webinars or seminars, (ii) subscribe to our newsletter or any other mailing list, (iii) submit a form in order to download any product, whitepaper, or other materials, (iv) participate in contests or respond to surveys, or (v) submit a form to request customer support or to contact Vantage Properties  for any other purpose.</p>

When you submit your card information, we store the name and address of the cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number. We do not store the actual credit card number. For quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.</p>

<p>iv. Testimonials : When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial.

<h3>Legal bases for collecting and using information</h3>

<p>Legal processing bases applicable to Vantage Properties  : If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal

Most of our information collection and processing activities are typically based on (i) contractual necessity, (ii) one or more
legitimate interests of Vantage Properties  or a third party that are not overridden by your data protection interests, or (iii)
your consent. Sometimes, we may be legally required to collect your information, or may need your personal information to protect
your vital interests or those of another person.</p>


<p>Withdrawal of consent : Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time,
but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.</p>


<p>Legitimate interests notice : Where we rely on legitimate interests as the legal basis and those legitimate interests are not
specified above, we will clearly explain to you what those legitimate interests are at the time that we collect your information.</p>

using the ‘unsubscribe’ function included in all such messages. However, you will continue to receive notices and essential

<h3>Part II – Information that Vantage Properties  processes on your behalf</h3>

<h4>Information entrusted to Vantage Properties  and purpose</h4>


<p>Information provided in connection with services : You may entrust information that you or your organization (“you”) control, to Vantage Properties  in connection with use of our services or for requesting technical support for our products. This includes information regarding your customers and your employees (if you are a controller) or data that you hold and use on behalf of another person for a specific purpose, such as a customer to whom you provide services (if you are a processor). The data may either be stored on our servers when you use our services, or transferred or shared to us as part of a request for technical support or other services.</p>


<p>Information from mobile devices : When you elect to allow it, some of our mobile applications have access to the camera, call history, contact information, photo library, and other information stored on your mobile device. Our applications require such access to provide their services. Similarly, when you elect to provide access, location-based information is also collected for purposes including, but not limited to, locating nearby contacts or setting location-based reminders. This information will be exclusively shared with our mapping providers and will be used only for mapping user locations. You may disable the mobile applications' access to this information at any time by editing the settings on your mobile device. The data stored on your mobile device and their location information to which the mobile applications have access will be used in the context of the mobile application, and transferred to and associated with your account in the corresponding services (in which case the data will be stored on our servers) or products (in which case the data will remain with you unless you share it with us).</p>


<p>(All the information entrusted to Vantage Properties  is collectively termed “service data”)</p>


<h4>Ownership and control of your service data</h4>

We ensure that access by our employees to your service data is restricted to specific individuals, and is logged and audited.

We communicate our privacy and security guidelines to our employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the Vantage Properties  group.</p>


<p>Collaborators and other users : Some of our products or services allow you to collaborate with other users or third parties.

<p>Third-party integrations you have enabled : Most of our products and services support integrations with third-party products and services. If you choose to enable any third-party integrations, you may be allowing the third party to access your service information and personal information about you. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of the third-party services and products before you enable integrations with them.</p>

<p>If you are from the European Economic Area and you believe that we store, use or process your information on behalf of one of our customers, please contact the customer if you would like to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object to processing, or export your personal data.

However, in the unlikely event that we sell our business or get acquired or merged, we will ensure that the acquiring entity is legally bound to honor our commitments to you.
